The naming convention we follow for the pruned models is straightforward; for instance, `ERES10_FPGM` refers to the EResFD model pruned with 10% sparsity using the FPGM technique. - `torchscript/`: All the required files for android deployment of the EResFD model (and its pruned versions) using the <SOFTWARE>torchscript</SOFTWARE> framework.  ## Prerequisites  Before running the pruning scripts, the user needs to prepare the necessary dataset:  ### <DATASET>WIDER FACE</DATASET> Dataset  The models are trained and evaluated using the <DATASET>WIDER FACE</DATASET> dataset.
