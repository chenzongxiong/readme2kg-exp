According to the features of defined salient objects within each of the sequences, multiple attributes, e.g., “multiple objects” (MO), “competing sounds” (CS), “geometrical distortion” (GD), “motion blur” (MB), “occlusions” (OC) and “low resolution” (LR) are further annotated to enable detailed analysis for <PROJECT>PAV-SOD</PROJECT> modeling.
