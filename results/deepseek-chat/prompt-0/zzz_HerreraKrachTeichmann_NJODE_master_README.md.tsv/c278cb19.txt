For easier evaluation after training, use the function-call: ``` get_training_overview(     params_extract_desc=('<DATASET>dataset</DATASET>', "other_model",                          'network_size', 'training_size',                          'hidden_size', "GRU_ODE_Bayes-mixing",                          "GRU_ODE_Bayes-logvar", "GRU_ODE_Bayes-impute",                          "GRU_ODE_Bayes-mixing"),     val_test_params_extract=(("max", "epoch", "epoch", "epochs_trained"),                              ("min", "evaluation_mean_diff",                               "evaluation_mean_diff", "eval_metric_min"),                              ("last", "evaluation_mean_diff",                               "evaluation_mean_diff", "eval_metric_last"),                              ("average", "evaluation_mean_diff",                               "evaluation_mean_diff", "eval_metric_average")                              ) ) ```  in extras.py.    ## Training on <DATASET>Climate Dataset</DATASET> The preprocessed climate data that was provided by [<SOFTWARE>GRU-ODE-Bayes</SOFTWARE>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12374) together with the cross-validation indices generated with their provided  code, is saved in data/training_data/climate/, s.t. models can be trained right  away.
