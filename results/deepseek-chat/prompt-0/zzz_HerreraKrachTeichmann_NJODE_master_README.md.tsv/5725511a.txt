These pre-trained models can be loaded and used to generate sample paths with  the following commands:  go to the source directory: ```demo cd controlled_ODE_RNN ```  - for Black-Scholes model: ```demo <PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> demo.py --model_id=1 ```  - for Heston model: ```demo <PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> demo.py --model_id=2 ```  - for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model: ```demo <PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> demo.py --model_id=3 ```  If no <DATASET>dataset</DATASET> for the model was generated yet, a small version of the <DATASET>dataset</DATASET>  with 100 samples will be generated automatically, such that plots can be  produced.
