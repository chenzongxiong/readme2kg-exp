We hope <SOFTWARE>PFHedge</SOFTWARE> accelerates the research and development of Deep Hedging.  ## Features  ### Imperative Experiences  * <SOFTWARE>PFHedge</SOFTWARE> is designed to be intuitive and imperative to streamline your research on Deep Hedging. * You can quickly build a `Hedger` and then `fit` and `price` derivatives right away. * You can easily tweak your model, risk measure, derivative, optimizer, and other setups on the fly.  ### Seamless Integration with <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>  * <SOFTWARE>PFHedge</SOFTWARE> is built to be deeply integrated into <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>. * Your Deep-Hedger can be built as a <SOFTWARE>Module</SOFTWARE> and trained by any <SOFTWARE>Optimizer</SOFTWARE>. * You can use GPUs to boost your hedging optimization (See below).  ### Effortless Extensions  * You can build new hedging models, derivatives, and features with little glue code. * You can build new hedging models by just subclassing <SOFTWARE>Module</SOFTWARE>. * You can quickly try out your own stochastic processes, derivatives, and input features.  ### Batteries Included  * <SOFTWARE>PFHedge</SOFTWARE> provides useful <SOFTWARE>Module</SOFTWARE>s for Deep Hedging in <SOFTWARE>pfhedge.nn</SOFTWARE>. * You can create [Black-Scholes' delta-hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_neutral), [Whalley-Wilmott's strategy][whalley-wilmott], and so forth. * Common risk measures such as [an entropic risk measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropic_risk_measure) and [an expected shortfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_shortfall) are available.  ## Install  ```sh pip install <SOFTWARE>pfhedge</SOFTWARE> ```  ## How to Use  [!
