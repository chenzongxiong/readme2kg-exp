To avoid repeating such a computationally expensive (when running LLMs on local machines) or costly (when calling the commercial APIs like `<SOFTWARE>GPT3.5</SOFTWARE>` or `<SOFTWARE>TigerBot</SOFTWARE>`) process, we have **released all the interactive logs with those LLMs collected in our experiments.**.
