This script will perform the following actions: - read real definitions of concepts from the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO</ONTOLOGY> ontology, together with synthetically generated ones   (as described at step 3) - ontology-driven generation of positive pairs of definitions by synonym substitution - ontology-driven generation of hard-negative pairs of definitions by: (i) indexing all definitions  in a collection of the [<SOFTWARE>Chroma DB embedding database</SOFTWARE>](https://www.trychroma.com/); (ii) identifying  for each definition the associated hard-negative one(s), relying on the is-a relations specified by  the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO</ONTOLOGY> ontology - infuse disease knowledge from the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO</ONTOLOGY> ontology in the embedding-LLM selected through command-line  **ARGUMENT 1**: this is obtained by relying on a contrastive learning framework relying on  InfoNCE loss (for more details refer the [<PUBLICATION>paper on ontological knowledge infusion</PUBLICATION>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20527))
