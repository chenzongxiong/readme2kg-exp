All in all, an instantiation of `<DATASET>WildlifeDataset</DATASET>` is done like:  ```<PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> from wildlifeml.data import <DATASET>WildlifeDataset</DATASET>  wd = <DATASET>WildlifeDataset</DATASET>(     keys=train_keys,     image_dir='<path_to_image_dir>',     detector_file_path='<path_to_images_megadetector.json>',     batch_size=8,     bbox_map=key_map,     label_file_path='<path_to_labels.csv>', ) ```  `do_cropping` is by default set to `True` and leads to the image being directly cropped to their respective bounding boxes when being loaded in the data process.  ### 04: Training a classifier  `<SOFTWARE>wildlife-ml</SOFTWARE>` contains the `<SOFTWARE>WildlifeTrainer</SOFTWARE>` that is an interface for directly training a classifier on the MD processed wildlife data.
