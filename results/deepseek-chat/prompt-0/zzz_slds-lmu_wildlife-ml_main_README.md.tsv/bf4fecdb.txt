Apart from our classification pipeline, we offer a simple interface for active learning.  ## Examples  We offer introductory minimal example scripts, which showcase our powerful package:  **EXAMPLE SCRIPTS COMING SOON**  *Please see our [experiments repository](https://github.com/<PROJECT>slds-lmu</PROJECT>/<PROJECT>wildlife-experiments</PROJECT>/) in the meantime :).*  ## Citation  By using this repo, please cite our paper <PUBLICATION>Automated wildlife image classification: An active learning tool for ecological applications</PUBLICATION>, here is a bibtex entry for it:  ``` @article{bothmann_et_al_2023,  title = {Automated wildlife image classification: {An} active learning tool for ecological applications},  volume = {77},  issn = {1574-9541},  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954123002601},  doi = {10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102231},  journal = {<PUBLICATION>Ecological Informatics</PUBLICATION>},  author = {Bothmann, Ludwig and Wimmer, Lisa and Charrakh, Omid and Weber, Tobias and Edelhoff, Hendrik and Peters, Wibke and Nguyen, Hien and Benjamin, Caryl and Menzel, Annette},  year = {2023},  pages = {102231} } ```  ## Workflow  ### 01: Folder structure  An optimal folder structure for working with our package is like:  ``` ├── labels.csv ├── images_megadetector.json └── images     ├── img_id1.xx     ├── ...     └── img_idn.xx ```  where `labels.csv` is a headless csv that contains entries as:  ``` img_id1.xx,<int_label> ... img_idn.xx,<int_label> ```  If your <DATASET>dataset</DATASET> follows the structure of separating classes by directories, we also offer a <SOFTWARE>DatasetConverter</SOFTWARE> for converting the file structure to the one above
