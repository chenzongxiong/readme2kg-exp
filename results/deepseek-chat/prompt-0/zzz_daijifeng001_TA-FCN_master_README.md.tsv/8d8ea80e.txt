For example, to train and test FCIS on <DATASET>COCO</DATASET> with <SOFTWARE>ResNet-v1-101</SOFTWARE>, use the following command     ```     <PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> experiments/fcis/fcis_end2end_train_test.py --cfg experiments/fcis/cfgs/resnet_v1_101_coco_fcis_end2end_ohem.yaml     ```     A cache folder would be created automatically to save the model and the log under `output/fcis/coco/` or `output/fcis/voc/`. 4.
