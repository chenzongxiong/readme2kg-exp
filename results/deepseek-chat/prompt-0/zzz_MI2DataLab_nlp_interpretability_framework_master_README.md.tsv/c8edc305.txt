**A robust model should be robust to changes in input that do not alter its semantics.** We test this property of 3 popular models: `<SOFTWARE>DrQA</SOFTWARE>`, `<SOFTWARE>BiDAF</SOFTWARE>` and `<SOFTWARE>QANet</SOFTWARE>` by manipulating questions in two ways- swapping important question word for:  1) its semantically correct synonym and 2) for word vector that is close in embedding space.
