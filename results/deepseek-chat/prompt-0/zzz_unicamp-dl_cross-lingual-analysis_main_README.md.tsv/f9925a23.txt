We experiment with the following transfer learning techniques: 1) fine-tuning a bilingual model on a source language and evaluating it on the target language without translation, i.e., in a zero-shot manner; 2) automatic translation of the training `<DATASET>dataset</DATASET>` to the target language; 3) automatic translation of the test set to the source language at inference time and evaluation of a model fine-tuned in `<PROGLANG>English</PROGLANG>`.
