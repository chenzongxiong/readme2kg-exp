In particular, it includes - the scripts needed to learn the <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE> models for extracting the narrative essence from either music albums (`<SOFTWARE>album_extractor.py</SOFTWARE>`) or movie frames (`<SOFTWARE>movie_extractor.py</SOFTWARE>`) and compute the lower bounds for the mutual information of the different features, - the scripts for learning a set of template curves from scalar descriptions of items in a set of collections (`<SOFTWARE>template_learner.py</SOFTWARE>`), - the code that can fit the scalar descriptions of items in a collection to a given template curve (`<SOFTWARE>fit_values</SOFTWARE>` in `<SOFTWARE>__main__.py</SOFTWARE>`), - the preprocessed album data used to train the original <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE> models for the music albums (`<DATASET>data/</DATASET>`), and - the learned <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE> models and template curves (`<DATASET>results/</DATASET>`).
