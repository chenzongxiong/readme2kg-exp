The interface is similar; however, <SOFTWARE>Jury</SOFTWARE> makes the metrics to take a unified input type by handling the inputs for each metrics, and allows supporting several input types as;  - single prediction & single reference - single prediction & multiple reference - multiple prediction & multiple reference  As a custom metric both base classes can be used; however, we strongly recommend using `<SOFTWARE>jury.metrics.Metric</SOFTWARE>` as it has several advantages such as supporting computations for the input types above or unifying the type of the input.
