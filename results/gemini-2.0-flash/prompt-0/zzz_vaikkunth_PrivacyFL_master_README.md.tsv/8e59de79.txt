NOTE: this quantitiy does incorporate other client's data if you set the config.USING_CUMULATIVE flag to False, since that indicates to clients that they should start training on this iteration using the federated weights from the previous iteration since the `<DATASET>`datasets`</DATASET>` aren't cumulative. ii) the federated accuracy: the `<EVALMETRIC>accuracy</EVALMETRIC>` of the federated model which is the average of all the clients' personal weights + differentially private noise for that iteration.
