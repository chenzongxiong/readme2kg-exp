In particular, it includes - the scripts needed to learn the `<PROGLANG>PyTorch</PROGLANG>` models for extracting the narrative essence from either music albums (`album_extractor.py`) or movie frames (`movie_extractor.py`) and compute the lower bounds for the mutual information of the different features, - the scripts for learning a set of template curves from scalar descriptions of items in a set of collections (`template_learner.py`), - the code that can fit the scalar descriptions of items in a collection to a given template curve (`fit_values` in `__main__.py`), - the preprocessed album data used to train the original `<PROGLANG>PyTorch</PROGLANG>` models for the music albums (`data/`), and - the learned `<PROGLANG>PyTorch</PROGLANG>` models and template curves (`results/`).
