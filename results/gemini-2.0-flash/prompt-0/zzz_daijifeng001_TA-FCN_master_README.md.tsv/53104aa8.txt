We strongly suggest the user rollback to version [MXNet@(commit 998378a)](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/998378a) for training (following Section 3.2 - 3.6).** ***Quick start*** 3.1 Install <SOFTWARE>MXNet</SOFTWARE> and all dependencies by ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` If there is no other error message, <SOFTWARE>MXNet</SOFTWARE> should be installed successfully.
