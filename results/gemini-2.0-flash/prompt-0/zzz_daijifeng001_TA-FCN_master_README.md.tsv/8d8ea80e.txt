For example, to train and test FCIS on `<DATASET>COCO</DATASET>` with `<PUBLICATION>ResNet-v1-101</PUBLICATION>`, use the following command ``` python experiments/fcis/fcis_end2end_train_test.py --cfg experiments/fcis/cfgs/resnet_v1_101_coco_fcis_end2end_ohem.yaml ``` A cache folder would be created automatically to save the model and the log under `output/fcis/coco/` or `output/fcis/voc/`. 4.
