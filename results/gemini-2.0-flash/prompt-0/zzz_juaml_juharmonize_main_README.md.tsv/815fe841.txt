# Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites ## About The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich Machine Learning Library It is currently being developed and maintained at the [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/applied-machine-learning-aml) group at [Forschungszentrum Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en), Germany. ## Overview **PrettYharmonize** is a <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG> package developed to address data leakage in the harmonization of biomedical datasets with site-specific variability, particularly under scenarios where class balance differs across data collection sites.
