Used for saving logs and weights. - `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size per gpu. - `WARMUP_EPOCHS`: Number of epochs for the warm-up phase. - `FINETUNE_EPOCHS`: Number of epochs for the fine-tuning phase. - `NUM_ITER`: Number of iterations of the SLR pseudo label estimation and fine-tuning. ### Individual training steps Individual steps of the SLR pipeline can also be executed separately, with the following <PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> scripts. #### Step I: Feature warm-up Train an initial model on partial labels generated from weak annotations and IMU.
