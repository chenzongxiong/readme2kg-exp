This repository contains the code for the paper "Self-Correcting Prompting Converts Weak Language Models into Strong Reasoners" published at `<CONFERENCE>NeurIPS 2022</CONFERENCE>`.

Self-Correcting Prompting (SCP) is a simple prompting method that improves the reasoning ability of language models. SCP iteratively refines its answers by prompting the language model to critique its own reasoning and generate a better answer.

We find that SCP significantly improves the performance of small language models on a variety of reasoning tasks. For example, SCP improves the accuracy of `<SOFTWARE>GPT-3</SOFTWARE>` (175B) on the `<DATASET>GSM8K</DATASET>` benchmark from 57.7% to 76.5%.

The code is written in `<PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>` and requires `<SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>`.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the code, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model <SOFTWARE>GPT-3</SOFTWARE> --dataset <DATASET>GSM8K</DATASET> --num_iterations 5
```

where `<SOFTWARE>GPT-3</SOFTWARE>` is the name of the language model to use, `<DATASET>GSM8K</DATASET>` is the name of the dataset to use, and `5` is the number of iterations to run.

The results will be saved to a file named `results.json`.

We also provide a `<SOFTWARE>Colab</SOFTWARE>` notebook that demonstrates how to use SCP. The notebook can be found here:
