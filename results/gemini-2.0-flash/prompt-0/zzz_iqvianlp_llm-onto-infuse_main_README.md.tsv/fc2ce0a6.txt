Hereinafter we describe the procedure to follow to infuse the disease knowledge formalized by the [disease ontology <ONTOLOGY>MONDO</ONTOLOGY>](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/) in four widespread embedding-LLMs and evaluate the ontology-enhanced embedding-LLMs against two widespread sentence-similarity datasets: [<DATASET>BIOSSES</DATASET>](https://huggingface.co/datasets/biosses) (biomedical domain) and the five test sets of <CONFERENCE>SemEval</CONFERENCE> Sentence Similarity challenges released yearly of [2012](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/sts12-sts), [2013](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/sts13-sts), [2014](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/sts14-sts), [2015](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/sts15-sts), [2016](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/sts16-sts). ### 1) Set-up environment - Create and activate a virtual environment based on <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG> 3.10.x. - Clone the repository, set the repo-folder as the working directory and install <proglang>python</proglang> requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Create a resource-folder - e.g.
