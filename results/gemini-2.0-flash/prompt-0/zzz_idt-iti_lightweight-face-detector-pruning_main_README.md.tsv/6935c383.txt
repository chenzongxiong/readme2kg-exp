The naming convention we follow for the pruned models is straightforward; for instance, `ERES10_FPGM` refers to the EResFD model pruned with 10% sparsity using the FPGM technique. - `torchscript/`: All the required files for android deployment of the EResFD model (and its pruned versions) using the `<SOFTWARE>torchscript</SOFTWARE>` framework. ## Prerequisites Before running the pruning scripts, the user needs to prepare the necessary `<DATASET>dataset</DATASET>`: ### `<DATASET>WIDER FACE Dataset</DATASET>` The models are trained and evaluated using the `<DATASET>WIDER FACE dataset</DATASET>`.
