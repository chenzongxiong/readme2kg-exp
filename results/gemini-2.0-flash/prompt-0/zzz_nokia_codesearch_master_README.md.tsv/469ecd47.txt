Note that this only makes sense to evaluate code-only models (i.e., models that do not use the description field). #### Example: load a snippet collection as evaluation data ```<PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG> queries, query2ids = load_eval_dataset("codesearchnet-<PROGLANG>python</PROGLANG>-valid") ``` ### Training data The different models we implement use different kinds of training data.
