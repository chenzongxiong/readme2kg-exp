It is suggested to put only those models (checkpoints and logs) you want to eval into one folder otherwise it will evaluate all the models in the folder  * **check intermediate results**: the model checkpoints and log files are saved in the selected log-directory (by default: `<DATASET>/log</DATASET>`).
