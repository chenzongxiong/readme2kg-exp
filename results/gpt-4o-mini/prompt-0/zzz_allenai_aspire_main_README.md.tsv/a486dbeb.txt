We develop multi-vector representations where vectors correspond to sentence-level aspects of documents, and present two methods for aspect matching: (1) A fast method that only matches single aspects, and (2) a method that makes sparse multiple matches with an <EVALMETRIC>Optimal Transport</EVALMETRIC> mechanism that computes an <EVALMETRIC>Earth Mover's Distance</EVALMETRIC> between aspects.
