Apply <PROGLANG>DTs</PROGLANG> to interpret trained <PROGLANG>NNs</PROGLANG> by approximating the network (mostly in terms of input-output mapping) and mimic the decision boundaries implicitly learned by the hidden layers.  ##### *1.2.1 Pedagogical Techniques.* Treat <PROGLANG>NNs</PROGLANG> as black-box approaches, and extract the input-output rule directly from <PROGLANG>NNs</PROGLANG> regardless of its intermediate layers.
