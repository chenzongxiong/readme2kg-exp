[SLR Architecture](resources/slr.png)  SLR is comprised of three steps. 1) The model is warmed-up using object-wise and global objectives derived from weak annotations and <ONTOLOGY>IMU</ONTOLOGY>. 2) The learned encoder features and model predictions are used to estimate the pseudo labels. 3) The network is fine-tuned on the estimated pseudo labels.
