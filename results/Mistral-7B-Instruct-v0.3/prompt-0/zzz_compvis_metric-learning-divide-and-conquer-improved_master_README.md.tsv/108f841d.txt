The **<DATASET>BookSum Dataset</DATASET>** and **<DATASET>MUSE Dataset</DATASET>** are used for evaluating the performance of the model. The **<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>** is used to measure the overall performance of the model. The **<PUBLICATION>Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</PUBLICATION>** contains the details of the experiments. The **<SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>** can be used to explore and edit the resource. The **<WORKSHOP>Thermal Image Super-Resolution</WORKSHOP>** workshop provides additional datasets for further analysis. The **<ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>** is used for knowledge representation in the project. The **<PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>** project (<https://<PROJECT>paperswithcode</PROJECT>.com/>) provides a platform for comparing different models. The **<LICENSE>cc-by-3</LICENSE>**
