`Used for saving logs and weights. - <EVALMETRIC>BATCH_SIZE</EVALMETRIC>: Batch size per gpu. - <EVALMETRIC>WARMUP_EPOCHS</EVALMETRIC>: Number of epochs for the warm-up phase. - <EVALMETRIC>FINETUNE_EPOCHS</EVALMETRIC>: Number of epochs for the fine-tuning phase. - <EVALMETRIC>NUM_ITER</EVALMETRIC>: Number of iterations of the SLR pseudo label estimation and fine-tuning.

### Individual training steps

Individual steps of the SLR pipeline can also be executed separately, with the following python scripts.

#### Step I: Feature warm-up

Train an initial model on partial labels generated from weak annotations and IMU.`
