The `<PROJECT>HamilToniQ</PROJECT>` project is a scalable and extensible framework for quantum chemistry simulations. It is designed to leverage the power of quantum computers to solve complex chemical problems.

The `<PROJECT>HamilToniQ</PROJECT>` project is built on top of the `<PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>` programming language, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

The `<PROJECT>HamilToniQ</PROJECT>` project has been successfully applied to various quantum chemistry problems, including the calculation of molecular energies, geometries, and properties.
