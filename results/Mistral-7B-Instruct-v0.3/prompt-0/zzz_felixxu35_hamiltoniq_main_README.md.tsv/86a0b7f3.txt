As a helpful Named Entity Recognition (NER) annotator, I can assist you in identifying and classifying named entities in text. Named entities can include people, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, and more.

To annotate text with NER, I follow these steps:

1. Tokenize the text: Break the text into individual words or tokens.
2. Part-of-speech tagging: Assign a part-of-speech tag to each token, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.
3. Named Entity Recognition: Identify and classify named entities in the text, such as "O" for other (non-named entity), "B-PERSON" for the beginning of a person's name, "I-ORG" for the continuation of an organization's name, etc.
4. Post-processing: Clean up the annotations and ensure they are consistent and accurate.

Here's an example of how I might annotate a sentence:

Original text: "John Smith, a software engineer at Google, was born in New York City."
