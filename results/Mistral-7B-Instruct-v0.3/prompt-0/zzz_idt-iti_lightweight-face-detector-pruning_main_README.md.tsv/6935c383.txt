The naming convention we follow for the pruned models is straightforward; for instance, `<PROJECT>ERES10_FPGM</PROJECT>` refers to the `<PROJECT>EResFD</PROJECT>` model pruned with 10% sparsity using the `<PROGLANG>FPGM</PROGLANG>` technique.
- `<DIRECTORY>torchscript/</DIRECTORY>`: All the required files for android deployment of the `<PROJECT>EResFD</PROJECT>` model (and its pruned versions) using the `<SOFTWARE>torchscript framework</SOFTWARE>`.

## Prerequisites
Before running the pruning scripts, the user needs to prepare the necessary dataset:
### `<DATASET>WIDER FACE Dataset</DATASET>`
The models are trained and evaluated using the `<DATASET>WIDER FACE Dataset</DATASET>`.
