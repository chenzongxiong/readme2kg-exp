The text provided does not contain any entities that fall under the given classes (CONFERENCE, DATASET, EVALMETRIC, LICENSE, ONTOLOGY, PROGLANG, PROJECT, PUBLICATION, SOFTWARE, WORKSHOP). However, it does contain a reference to a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (Python) and a REQUIREMENT (requirements.txt). Here's the annotated text:

```
To ensure compatibility and proper functionality of the pruning scripts, please install the specific versions of the `<PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE>Python</PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE>` packages listed in the `<REQUIREMENT>requirements.txt</REQUIREMENT>` file, using the following command:  ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ```  ## Running the Scripts for Pruning a Face Detector
```

In this case, I've added the `PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE` and `REQUIREMENT` tags to the text.
