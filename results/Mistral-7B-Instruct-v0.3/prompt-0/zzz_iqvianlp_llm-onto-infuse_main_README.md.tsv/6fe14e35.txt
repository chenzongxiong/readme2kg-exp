This script will perform the following actions:
- read real definitions of concepts from the `<ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY>`, together with synthetically generated ones (as described at step 3)
- ontology-driven generation of positive pairs of definitions by synonym substitution
- ontology-driven generation of hard-negative pairs of definitions by:
  (i) indexing all definitions in a collection of the `<DATASET>Chroma DB embedding database</DATASET>`
  (ii) identifying for each definition the associated hard-negative one(s), relying on the is-a relations specified by the `<ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY>`
- infuse disease knowledge from the `<ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY>` in the embedding-LLM selected through command-line `<ARGUMENT 1>`: this is obtained by relying on a contrastive learning framework relying on InfoNCE loss (for more details refer the [paper on ontological knowledge infusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.
