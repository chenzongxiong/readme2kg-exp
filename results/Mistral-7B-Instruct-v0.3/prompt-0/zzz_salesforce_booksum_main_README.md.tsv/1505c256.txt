`[Citation](#<PUBLICATION>3</PUBLICATION>)` The `<PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>` project (https://<PROJECT>paperswithcode</PROJECT>.com/) provides a platform for researchers to share their code and datasets related to various computer vision tasks. The project includes a wide range of datasets such as `<DATASET>Maules Creek</DATASET>`, `<DATASET>USTPO MIT</DATASET>`, and `<DATASET>Cityscapes</DATASET>`. The evaluation metrics used are `<EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>`, and `<EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC>`. The `<SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>` can be used to explore and edit the resource. The `<ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>` is also available for those
