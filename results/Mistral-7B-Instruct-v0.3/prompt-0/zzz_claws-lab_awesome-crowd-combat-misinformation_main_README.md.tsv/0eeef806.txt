`Crowdsourcing <PROJECT>CrowdAI</PROJECT>`, to collect and annotate large-scale datasets for various tasks, such as `<DATASET>ImageNet</DATASET>` and `<DATASET>COCO</DATASET>`. These datasets have been instrumental in driving the progress of computer vision research.

For instance, the `<ONTOLOGY>ImageNet Ontology</ONTOLOGY>` is a semantic framework that provides a structured representation of the concepts and relationships within the `<DATASET>ImageNet</DATASET>` dataset.

Moreover, the `<CONFERENCE>CVPR 2023</CONFERENCE>` workshop on `<WORKSHOP>Thermal Image Super-Resolution</WORKSHOP>` will delve into the latest advancements in thermal image super-resolution techniques.

The `<SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>` is widely used for creating ontologies, and it can be employed to explore and edit the resource.

Lastly, the evaluation metrics used in this study are `<EVALMETRIC>Precision
