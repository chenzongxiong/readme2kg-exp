In each assigned role, we conduct a detailed analysis to categorize the specific utilization of the `<PROJECT>crowd</PROJECT>`.

The `<ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>` is used to represent the knowledge about the roles.

The `<SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>` can be used to explore and edit the ontology.

The evaluation metrics used are `<EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>`, and `<EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC>`.
