# 3D CMR-Domain-Adaptation
This repo contains code to train a deep learning model for **Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)** of 3D cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images to **transform from axial to short-axis orientation**.

- The **PROJECT** is `3D CMR-Domain-Adaptation`.
- The **SOFTWARE** used is for training a deep learning model, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the text.
- The goal of the project is to achieve **Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)** of 3D cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images to **transform from axial to short-axis orientation**.
