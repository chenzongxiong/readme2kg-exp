The text includes - the scripts needed to learn the `<SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>` models for extracting the narrative essence from either music albums (`<FILE>album_extractor.py</FILE>`) or movie frames (`<FILE>movie_extractor.py</FILE>`) and compute the lower bounds for the mutual information of the different features, - the scripts for learning a set of template curves from scalar descriptions of items in a set of collections (`<FILE>template_learner.py</FILE>`), - the code that can fit the scalar descriptions of items in a collection to a given template curve (`<FUNCTION>fit_values</FUNCTION>` in `<FILE>__main__.py</FILE>`), - the preprocessed album data used to train the original `<SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>` models for the music albums (`<DIRECTORY>data/</DIRECTORY>`), and - the learned `<SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE>` models and template curves (`<DIRECTORY>results/</DIRECTORY>`).
