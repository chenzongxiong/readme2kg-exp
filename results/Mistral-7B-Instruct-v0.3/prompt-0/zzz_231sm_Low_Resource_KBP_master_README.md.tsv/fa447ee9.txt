# Low_Resource_KBP knowledge graph population in low resource conditions
The file "*<DATASET>Few-Shot_ED</DATASET>.json.zip*" is the ***<CONFERENCE>FewEvent</CONFERENCE>*** dataset for the paper accepted by ***<CONFERENCE>WSDM 2020</CONFERENCE>*** ["Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11621)***

## Source of Raw Data * We first scale up the number of event types in existing datasets, including the [<DATASET>ACE-2005 corpus</DATASET>](http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/) and [<DATASET>TAC-KBP-2017 Event Track Data</DATASET>](https://tac.nist.gov/2017/KBP/Event/index.html)
