1. The `<PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>` project (https://<PROJECT>paperswithcode</PROJECT>.com/) is a platform that aims to `<ONTOLOGY>facilitate the reproducibility of machine learning research</ONTOLOGY>`. It provides a `<DATASET>dataset leaderboard</DATASET>` for various tasks, such as `<DATASET>object detection</DATASET>`, `<DATASET>image classification</DATASET>`, and `<DATASET>semantic segmentation</DATASET>`. The `<DATASET>leaderboard</DATASET>` ranks models based on their performance on different `<EVALMETRIC>evaluation metrics</EVALMETRIC>`, such as `<EVALMETRIC>accuracy</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>precision</EVALMETRIC>`, and `<EVALMETRIC>recall</EVALMETRIC>`.
