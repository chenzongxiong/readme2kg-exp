- **PROGLANG**: Earth Mover's Distance

The annotated text in Markdown format is:

We develop multi-vector representations where vectors correspond to sentence-level aspects of documents, and present two methods for aspect matching: (1) A fast method that only matches single aspects, and (2) a method that makes sparse multiple matches with an `<EVALMETRIC>Earth Mover's Distance</EVALMETRIC>` mechanism that computes an Optimal Transport mechanism.
