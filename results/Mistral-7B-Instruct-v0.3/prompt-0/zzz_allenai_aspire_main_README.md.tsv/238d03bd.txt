The `<PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>` project (https://<PROJECT>paperswithcode</PROJECT>.com/) provides a collection of `<DATASET>Maules Creek</DATASET>` and other datasets for researchers to use. The `<SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>` is widely used for creating ontologies. The `<ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>` is a semantic framework for representing knowledge about intelligence tasks. The evaluation metrics used are `<EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>`, and `<EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC>`. The `<CONFERENCE>International Semantic Web Conference 2019</CONFERENCE>` (ISWC 2019) and the `<WORKSHOP>Thermal Image Super-Resolution</WORKSHOP>` are examples of
