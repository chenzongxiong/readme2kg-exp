The <PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT> project (https://<PROJECT>paperswithcode</PROJECT>.com/) is a platform for sharing and evaluating machine learning papers and code. The <PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT> project provides a comprehensive benchmark for various machine learning tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification.

The <PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT> project also offers a leaderboard that ranks models based on their performance on the benchmark datasets. This allows researchers to compare their models with others in the field and identify areas for improvement.

In addition to the benchmark and leaderboard, the <PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT> project also provides a code search engine that allows users to find and reuse code from published papers. This can save researchers time and effort when implementing machine learning models.
