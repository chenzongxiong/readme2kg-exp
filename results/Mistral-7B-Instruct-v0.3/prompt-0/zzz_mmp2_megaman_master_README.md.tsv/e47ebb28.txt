It has a front-end API designed to be familiar to `<PROGLANG>scikit-learn</PROGLANG>`, but harnesses the `<SOFTWARE>C++ Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN)</SOFTWARE>` and the `<SOFTWARE>Sparse Symmetric Positive Definite (SSPD) solver Locally Optimal Block Precodition Gradient (LOBPCG) method</SOFTWARE>` to scale manifold learning algorithms to large data sets.
