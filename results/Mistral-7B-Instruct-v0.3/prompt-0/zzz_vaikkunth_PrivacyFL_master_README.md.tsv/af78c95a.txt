The text provided does not contain any named entities according to the given guidelines. However, if we assume that `iters` and `iterations` are variables or parameters in a programming context, we can annotate them as follows:

`For the example shown in the repository, only set `<PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>` `iters` to be equal to or less than to the `<PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>` `iterations` argument in the **Initializer** `__init__` method, since that is the method that creates the datasets and distributes them to the clients.`
