The text provided does not contain any of the specified entity classes. However, if we were to find a conference or workshop name within the text, it would be annotated as follows:

`<CONFERENCE>Each client trains its weights from scratch each iteration</CONFERENCE>`

This annotation is not accurate, as the text does not contain a conference or workshop name. The given text only refers to a process related to training weights in a machine learning context.
