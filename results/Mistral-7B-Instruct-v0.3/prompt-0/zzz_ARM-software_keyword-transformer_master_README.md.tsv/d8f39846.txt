**Note**: Installing the correct `<PROGLANG>TensorFlow</PROGLANG>` version is important for reproducibility!

The `<SOFTWARE>Anaconda Navigator</SOFTWARE>` can help you manage and install different versions of `<PROGLANG>TensorFlow</PROGLANG>`.

You can find the specific version you need on the `<PUBLICATION>TensorFlow Documentation</PUBLICATION>` (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

For example, to install TensorFlow 2.x, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install tensorflow==2.x
```

Make sure to replace `x` with the exact version number you want to install.

After installing the correct version, you can verify it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This should print the version number you installed.
