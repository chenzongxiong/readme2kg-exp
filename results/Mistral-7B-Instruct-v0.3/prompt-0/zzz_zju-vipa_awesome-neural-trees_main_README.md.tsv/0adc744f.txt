The given text does not contain any of the specified entity classes. However, I can help you understand how to annotate entities if they were present.

For example, if the text contained "International Semantic Web Conference 2019", it would be annotated as follows:

`If a NDT satisfies this property, it means each internal node is assigned a specific and intermediate <CONFERENCE>International Semantic Web Conference 2019</CONFERENCE> classification task.`

In Markdown format:

```
If a NDT satisfies this property, it means each internal node is assigned a specific and intermediate **<CONFERENCE>International Semantic Web Conference 2019</CONFERENCE>** classification task.
```
