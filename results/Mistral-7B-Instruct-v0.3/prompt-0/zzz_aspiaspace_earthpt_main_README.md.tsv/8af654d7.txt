## install
Dependencies:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## results
Our EarthPT-700M model is able to predict future satellite passes well into the future, and also learns semantically meaningful information about the timeseries that it is fed:

You can find a plot with less angular momentum and further results in our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07207).

## pretrained weights
You can find our weights for all the EarthPT models on [HuggingFace](https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/1598) ðŸ¤— .
