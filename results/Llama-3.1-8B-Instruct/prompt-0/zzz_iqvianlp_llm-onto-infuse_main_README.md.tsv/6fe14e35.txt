This script will perform the following actions: 
- read real definitions of concepts from the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY>, together with synthetically generated ones   (as described at step 3) 
- ontology-driven generation of positive pairs of definitions by synonym substitution 
- ontology-driven generation of hard-negative pairs of definitions by: (i) indexing all definitions  in a collection of the <SOFTWARE>Chroma DB embedding database</SOFTWARE> (<DATASET>Chroma DB</DATASET>) ([https://www.trychroma.com/](https://www.trychroma.com/)); (ii) identifying  for each definition the associated hard-negative one(s), relying on the is-a relations specified by  the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY> 
- infuse disease knowledge from the <ONTOLOGY>MONDO ontology</ONTOLOGY> in the embedding-LLM selected through command-line  **<SOFTWARE>ARGUMENT 1</SOFTWARE>**: this is obtained by relying on a contrastive learning framework relying on  <EVALMETRIC>InfoNCE loss</EVALMETRIC> (for more details refer the <PUBLICATION>paper on ontological knowledge infusion</PUBLICATION> [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20527))
