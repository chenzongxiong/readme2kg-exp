The <SOFTWARE>QPU Performance Evaluation Toolkit</SOFTWARE> highlighted features include:  
- Easy to use: Users only need to call QPUs, run the main function, and get the scores.  
- Comprehensive scoring system: The toolkit generates a single score, termed <EVALMETRIC>H-Score</EVALMETRIC>, capturing all relevant QPU performance factors such as error rates, circuit compilation, and quantum error mitigation.  
- Standardized and comparable results: <EVALMETRIC>H-Scores</EVALMETRIC> ensure consistent and comparable evaluation across different platforms.  
- Focusing on real-world application: The toolkit is based on optimization algorithms to reflect actual application scenarios.  
- Multi-QPU support: Utility in multi-QPU resource management has been demonstrated.
