The <SOFTWARE>PyTorch</SOFTWARE> library's `writer.add_text()` function is used to log text data. However, the cause texts from `writer.add_text()` to not show up can be due to several reasons.

1.  **Incorrect Logging Level**: Ensure that the logging level is set to a level that will display the logged text. For example, you can use `writer.add_text('text', 'example_text', global_step=0)` and then `writer.flush()` to force the logging to happen.

2.  **Missing Flush Operation**: The `writer.add_text()` function does not automatically flush the log. You need to call the `writer.flush()` method after adding the text to ensure it gets written to the log file.

3.  **Incorrect Text Content**: The text content being logged might not be correctly formatted or might not be a valid string. Make sure the text is a valid string and does not contain any special characters that could cause issues.

4.  **Logging to a File**: If you are logging to a file, ensure that the file is properly closed after writing to it. You can use the `writer.close()` method to close the file.

5.  **Environment Variables**: Some environment variables might be interfering with the logging process. Try setting the `PYTORCH_NO_GLOBAL_STATS` environment variable to `1` to disable global statistics.

6.  **PyTorch Version**: The issue might be related to a specific version of PyTorch. Try updating to the latest version or downgrading to a previous version to see if the issue persists.

If none of these solutions work, you can try debugging the issue by printing out the text content before adding it to the writer to see if it's being correctly formatted.
