# <PROJECT>Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites</PROJECT> 
## About 
The <PROJECT>The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich Machine Learning Library</PROJECT> 
It is currently being developed and maintained at the <WORKSHOP>Applied Machine Learning</WORKSHOP> group at <ORGANIZATION>Forschungszentrum Juelich</ORGANIZATION>, Germany.   
## Overview  
**<SOFTWARE>PrettYharmonize</SOFTWARE>** is a <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG> package developed to address data leakage in the harmonization of biomedical datasets with site-specific variability, particularly under scenarios where class balance differs across data collection sites.
