### Preparing the data
1. Download the `<DATASET>Maules Creek</DATASET>` dataset from the official website.
2. Extract the downloaded dataset into the `<SOFTWARE>data</SOFTWARE>` directory.
3. Create a new directory named `<SOFTWARE>output</SOFTWARE>` to store the results.
4. Run the following command to preprocess the data: `python <SOFTWARE>preprocess.py</SOFTWARE>`.
5. The preprocessed data will be stored in the `<SOFTWARE>output</SOFTWARE>` directory.
6. Next, we need to train a model using the preprocessed data. We will use the `<SOFTWARE>TensorFlow</SOFTWARE>` framework to train a deep learning model.
7. The trained model will be saved in the `<SOFTWARE>output</SOFTWARE>` directory.
8. Finally, we will use the trained model to make predictions on the test data and evaluate its performance using the `<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>`, `<EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>`, and `<EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>` metrics.

The `<PROJECT>Data Preparation</PROJECT>` project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for data preparation, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The project is built using the `<PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>` programming language and utilizes popular libraries such as `<SOFTWARE>Pandas</SOFTWARE>`, `<SOFTWARE>NumPy</SOFTWARE>`, and `<SOFTWARE>TensorFlow</SOFTWARE>`.
