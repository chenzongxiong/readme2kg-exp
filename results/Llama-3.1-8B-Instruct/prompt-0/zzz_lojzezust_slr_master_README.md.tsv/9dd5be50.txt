[SLR Architecture](<CONFERENCE>resources/slr.png</CONFERENCE>)  SLR is comprised of three steps. 1) The model is warmed-up using object-wise and global objectives derived from weak annotations and IMU. 2) he learned encoder features and model predictions are used to estimate the pseudo labels. 3) The network is fine-tuned on the estimated pseudo labels.
