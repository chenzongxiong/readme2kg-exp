The <SOFTWARE>Protege Ontology Editor</SOFTWARE> is widely used for creating ontologies. It has a large user base and supports various ontologies. The <CONFERENCE>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence</CONFERENCE> featured a presentation on the editor's capabilities. The <DATASET>OpenI Dataset</DATASET> was used to train a model that integrates with the editor. The <EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC> was used to evaluate the model's performance. The <LICENSE>Apache License 2.0</LICENSE> governs the use of the editor. The <ONTOLOGY>Ontology of Biomedical Entities</ONTOLOGY> is supported by the editor. The <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG> programming language is used to create plugins for the editor. The <PROJECT>Open Ontology</PROJECT> project aims to create a community-driven ontology. The <PUBLICATION>A Survey of Ontology-Based Data Access</PUBLICATION> paper discusses the editor's role in ontology-based data access. The <SOFTWARE>GraphDB</SOFTWARE> is another ontology editor that competes with Protege. The <CONFERENCE>ISWC 2019</CONFERENCE> featured a workshop on ontology-based data access. The <WORKSHOP>Ontology Engineering Workshop</WORKSHOP> was held at the conference.
