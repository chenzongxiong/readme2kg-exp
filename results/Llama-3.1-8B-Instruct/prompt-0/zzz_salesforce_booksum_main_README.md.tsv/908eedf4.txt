The script needs to be run separately for each split as the matched file `cd paragraph-level-summary-alignments <SOFTWARE>python</SOFTWARE> gather_data.py --matched_file /path/to/chapter_summary_aligned_{train/test/val}_split.jsonl --split_paragraphs`
Generate alignments of the paragraphs with sentences from the summary using the bi-encoder `<SOFTWARE>paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1</SOFTWARE>` 
`<SOFTWARE>python</SOFTWARE> align_data_bi_encoder_paraphrase.py --data_path /path/to/chapter_summary_aligned_{train/test/val}_split.jsonl.gathered --stable_alignment`
## Troubleshooting
1. If the script is unable to find the matched file, ensure that the path is correct and the file exists. 
2. If the script is unable to find the `<SOFTWARE>paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1</SOFTWARE>` model, ensure that it is installed and available in the system's Python environment.
