The naming convention we follow for the pruned models is straightforward; for instance, `<SOFTWARE>ERES10_FPGM</SOFTWARE>` refers to the `<SOFTWARE>EResFD</SOFTWARE>` model pruned with 10% sparsity using the `<SOFTWARE>FPGM</SOFTWARE>` technique. - `torchscript/`: All the required files for android deployment of the `<SOFTWARE>EResFD</SOFTWARE>` model (and its pruned versions) using the `<SOFTWARE>torchscript</SOFTWARE>` framework.  
## Prerequisites  
Before running the pruning scripts, the user needs to prepare the necessary dataset:  
### WIDER FACE <DATASET>  
The models are trained and evaluated using the `<DATASET>WIDER FACE</DATASET>` dataset.
