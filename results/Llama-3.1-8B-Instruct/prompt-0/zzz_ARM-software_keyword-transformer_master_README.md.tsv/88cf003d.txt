/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz cd../ 
And similarly for V1: 
```shell
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/data/<DATASET>speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz</DATASET>
mkdir <SOFTWARE>data1</SOFTWARE>
mv <SOFTWARE>data1</SOFTWARE>.
```

Note: The `<DATASET>` and `<SOFTWARE>` tags are added based on the context, which appears to be related to a dataset and a software tool used for data management, respectively.
