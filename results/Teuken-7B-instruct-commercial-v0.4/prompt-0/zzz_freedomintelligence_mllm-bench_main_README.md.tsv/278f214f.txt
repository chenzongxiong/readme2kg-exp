**Guidelines:**

1. **Entity Classes:**
   - **CONFERENCE**: Conference events.
   - **DATASET**: Structured collections of data.
   - **EVALMETRIC**: Evaluation metrics for models.
   - **LICENSE**: Licensing terms.
   - **ONTOLOGY**: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
   - **PROJECT**: Scientific or business initiatives.
   - **PUBLICATION**: Scholarly works.
   - **SOFTWARE**: Software tools or programs.
   - **WORKSHOP**: Workshop events.

2. **Annotation Rules:**
   - Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
   - Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
   - Annotate nested entities separately.
   - Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
   - Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).

3. **Output Format:**
   - Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
     - `The <SOFTWARE>Protege Ontology Editor</SOFTWARE> is widely used for creating ontologies.`
   - Your output should be in Markdown format with all entities tagged as instructed.
