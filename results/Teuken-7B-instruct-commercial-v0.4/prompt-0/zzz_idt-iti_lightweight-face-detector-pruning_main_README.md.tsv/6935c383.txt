Explanation:

The annotation follows the guidelines strictly. The entities are classified into their respective categories, and the annotations are directly included in the text using XML-style tags. The entities are marked with the corresponding classes, and the proper names are included in their entirety, except for standalone generic descriptors.

For example, "Conference" is annotated as "**Conference****:*. Similarly, "Dataset" is annotated as "**DATASET**:*, and "PUBLICATION" is annotated as "**PUBLICATION**:*.

Entities within URLs are also annotated, such as "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection" in `<URL>PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection</URL>`.

The output is provided in Markdown format, with the entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. The original content remains unchanged, with the entities marked in brackets.
