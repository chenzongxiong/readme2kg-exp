```
## Annotation Rules
- Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
- Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
- Annotate nested entities separately.
- Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
- Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).
- Use lowercase for all entities.
## Output Format
- Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
    - `<DATASET>BookSum Dataset</DATASET>`
    - `<ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>`
    - `<WORKSHOP>PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection</WORKSHOP>`
    - `<LICENSE>AGPL 3.0v license</LICENSE>`
    - `<PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>`
    - `<PUBLICATION>No Length Left Behind: Enhancing Knowledge Tracing for Modeling Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths</PUBLICATION>. In <PUBLICATION>Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</PUBLICATION>`
- Your output should be in Markdown format with all entities tagged as instructed.
