**Task:** You are tasked with performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the given text. Follow the guidelines strictly to identify and classify entities into their respective categories. Annotate the entities directly in the original text using XML-style tags. Only return the annotated text in Markdown formatâ€”no explanations, introductions, or extra text.

**Guidelines:**
1. **Entity Classes:**
* **CONFERENCE**: Conference events.
* **DATASET**: Structured collections of data.
* **EVALMETRIC**: Evaluation metrics for models.
* **LICENSE**: Licensing terms.
* **ONTOLOGY**: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
* **PROJECT**: Scientific or business initiatives.
* **PUBLICATION**: Scholarly works.
* **SOFTWARE**: Software tools or programs.
* **WORKSHOP**: Workshop events.
2. **Annotation Rules:**
* Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
* Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
* Annotate nested entities separately.
* Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
* Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).
3. **Output Format:**
* Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
