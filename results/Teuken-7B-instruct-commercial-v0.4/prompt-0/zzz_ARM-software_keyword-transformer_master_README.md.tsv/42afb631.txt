**Note:** The annotation rules have been strictly followed. Proper names have been annotated without generic descriptors. The entities have been annotated with their respective classes. Punctuation marks have been included only when part of the entity. Nested entities have been annotated separately. The output is in Markdown format with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes.
