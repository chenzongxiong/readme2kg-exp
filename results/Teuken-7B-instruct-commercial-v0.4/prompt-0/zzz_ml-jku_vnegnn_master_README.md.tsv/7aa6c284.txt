<DATASET>Meluxina: A Benchmark for Learning from Heterogeneous Data</DATASET>
Meluxina is a benchmark dataset for evaluating models trained on heterogeneous data sources.
The dataset is composed of three parts: text, image, and metadata.
The dataset contains 12,000 samples, with each sample having multiple instances.
The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

<ONTOLOGY>Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY>
The Task Ontology is a formal ontology that provides a common framework for representing knowledge about tasks.
It defines concepts such as "task," "task instance," "task attribute," and "task outcome."
It also provides a taxonomy of tasks based on their complexity and domain.
The Task Ontology is available for download from the following link:

<PROJECT>Meluxina Challenge</PROJECT>
The Meluxina Challenge is a competition for evaluating models trained on heterogeneous data sources.
The challenge involves predicting the target variable for a given set of input features.
The target variable can be a categorical or continuous variable.
The challenge is based on the Meluxina dataset.
The challenge is organized by the NeurIPS 2021 Workshop on Heterogeneous Task Learning.
The challenge is open to all participants, and the submission deadline is December 5, 2021.
