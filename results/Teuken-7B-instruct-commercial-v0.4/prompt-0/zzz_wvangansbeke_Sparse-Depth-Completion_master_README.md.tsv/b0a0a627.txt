**Annotated Text:**
```markdown
**Entity Classes:**

* DATASET
* EVALMETRIC
* LICENSE
* ONTOLOGY
* PROJECT
* PUBLICATION

**Annotation Rules:**

* Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
* Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
* Annotate nested entities separately.
* Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
* Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).

Output Format:

* Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
   - `The <SOFTWARE>Protege Ontology Editor</SOFTWARE> is widely used for creating ontologies.`

**Entities:**

* DATASET: Structured collections of data.
	+ Evaluation metrics used: <EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>, <EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>, <EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>, and <EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC>.
* ONTOLOGY: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
* PROJECT: Scientific or business initiatives.
