Annotation Rules:

1. Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
2. Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
3. Annotate nested entities separately.
4. Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
5. Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `<URL>https://ai.meta.com/llama</URL>`).

Output Format:
