The <CONFERENCE>Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT* 2021)</CONFERENCE> is an essential event for discussing and addressing issues related to fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI and machine learning.

The <DATASET>Fairness Metric Learning for Machine Learning Fairness</DATASET> dataset, also known as the FairML dataset, contains 10 different fairness metrics for evaluating machine learning models. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on fairness in machine learning.

The <EVALMETRIC>Equal Error Rate (EER)</EVALMETRIC> is a commonly used evaluation metric for evaluating the performance of binary classifiers. It is calculated by taking the average of the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR).

The <LICENSE>MIT License</LICENSE> allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the work, as long as the original author is credited.

The <ONTOLOGY>CIDOC-CRM</ONTOLOGY> is a standardized ontology for representing cultural heritage resources.

The <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG> programming language is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

The <PROJECT>Fairness Metrics and Counterfactuals for Machine Learning (FAIRNESS++)</PROJECT> project aims to develop and evaluate fairness metrics and counterfactual methods for machine learning.

The <PUBLICATION>Patterns of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning: A Case Study on Deep Learning</PUBLICATION> presents a case study on the use of machine learning models for predicting credit card fraud.

The <SOFTWARE>JEDI (Just Another Comparison Engine for Discovery)</SOFTWARE> is a tool for comparing and evaluating machine learning models.

The <WORKSHOP>Workshop on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT* 2021)</WORKSHOP> is a workshop focused on the topic of fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning.
