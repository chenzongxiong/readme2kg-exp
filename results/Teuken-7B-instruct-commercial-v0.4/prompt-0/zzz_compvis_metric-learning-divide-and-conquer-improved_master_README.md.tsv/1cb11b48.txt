## Annotation Rules
- Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
- Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
- Annotate nested entities separately.
- Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
- Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).
- Use the following classes:
  - CONFERENCE: Conference events.
  - DATASET: Structured collections of data.
  - EVALMETRIC: Evaluation metrics for models.
  - LICENSE: Licensing terms.
  - ONTOLOGY: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
  - PROJECT: Scientific or business initiatives.
  - PUBLICATION: Scholarly works.
  - SOFTWARE: Software tools or programs.
  - WORKSHOP: Workshop events.
