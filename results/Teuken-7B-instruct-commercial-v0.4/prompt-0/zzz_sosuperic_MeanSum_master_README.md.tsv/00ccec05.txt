11. **Annotation Rules:**
Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
Annotate nested entities separately.
Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in <https://ai.meta.com/llama>).
12. **Output Format:**
Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
