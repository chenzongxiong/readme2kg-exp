Task: Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the given text.

Guidelines:
1. Entity Classes:
	* CONFERENCE: Conference events.
	* DATASET: Structured collections of data.
	* EVALMETRIC: Evaluation metrics for models.
	* LICENSE: Licensing terms.
	* ONTOLOGY: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
	* PROGLANG: Programming languages.
	* PROJECT: Scientific or business initiatives.
	* PUBLICATION: Scholarly works.
	* SOFTWARE: Software tools or programs.
	* WORKSHOP: Workshop events.
2. Annotation Rules:
   - Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
   - Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
   - Annotate nested entities separately.
   - Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
   - Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).
3. Output Format:
   - Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
     - <CONFERENCE>International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)</CONFERENCE>
     - <DATASET>Amazon Missions Corpus</DATASET>
     - <EVALMETRIC>Macro F1 Score</EVALMETRIC>
     - <LICENSE>CC0</LICENSE>
     - <ONTOLOGY>BIBO</ONTOLOGY>
     - <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>
     - <PROJECT>AudioSet Detection Challenge</PROJECT>
     - <PUBLICATION>Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)</PUBLICATION>
     - <SOFTWARE>spaCy</SOFTWARE>
     - <WORKSHOP>Workshop on Semantic Reasoning over Knowledge Bases (SeRK)</WORKSHOP>
