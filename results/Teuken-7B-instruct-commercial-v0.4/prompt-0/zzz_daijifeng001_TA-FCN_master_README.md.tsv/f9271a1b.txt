Task: Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the given text.

Guidelines:

* Entity Classes:

   - **CONFERENCE**: Conference events.
   
     Definition: A formal meeting or gathering focused on a particular field of study or topic.
     Example: International Semantic Web Conference 2019, ISWC 2019, CVPR2023 workshop.

   - **DATASET**: Structured collections of data.
   
     Definition: A structured collection of data, organized typically for a specific goal such as analysis, research, or reference.
     Example: Maules Creek, USTPO MIT dataset from <https://github.com/wenggong-jin/nips17-rexgen/blob/master/USPTO/data.zip>.

   - **EVALMETRIC**: Evaluation metrics for models.
   
     Definition: A quantitative measure used to assess the performance and effectiveness of a statistical or machine learning model.
     Example: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, BLEU Score.

   - **LICENSE**: Licensing terms.
   
     Definition: Legal terms and conditions for using a particular resource.
     Example: cc-by-3, CC BY-NC 4.0.

   - **ONTOLOGY**: Semantic frameworks for knowledge representation.
   
     Definition: A framework representing knowledge about a domain, including concepts, entities, properties, and relationships.
     Example: Intelligence Task Ontology.

   - **PROGLANG**: Programming languages.
   
     Definition: A formal language used for implementing software.
     Example: Python, PHP, C++.

   - **PROJECT**: Scientific or business initiatives.
   
     Definition: A planned initiative aimed at addressing a research question or achieving a specific goal.
     Example: Paper With Code project <https://paperswithcode.com/>.

   - **PUBLICATION**: Scholarly works.
   
     Definition: A creative work resulting from a publishing process, such as a journal article, conference proceeding, or preprint.
     Example: No Length Left Behind: Enhancing Knowledge Tracing for Modeling Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths, in Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management.

   - **SOFTWARE**: Software tools or programs.
   
     Definition: Programs or tools designed to perform specific tasks on electronic devices.
     Example: Protege ontology editor.

   - **WORKSHOP**: Workshop events.
   
     Definition: An educational or hands-on session focused on a specific subject.
     Example: [Thermal Image Super-Resolution](https://pbvs-workshop.github.io/datasets.html) workshop.

Annotation Rules:

1. Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude Dataset in BookSum Dataset).
2. Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
3. Annotate nested entities separately.
4. Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
5. Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in <https://ai.meta.com/llama>).

Output Format:

Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes.
