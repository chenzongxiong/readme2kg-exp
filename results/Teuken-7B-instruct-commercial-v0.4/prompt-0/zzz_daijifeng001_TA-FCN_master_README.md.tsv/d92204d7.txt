#### Disclaimer
This is an official implementation for [Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07709) (FCIS) based on MXNet.

> PROJECT
> ========

The FCIS project aims to develop a semantic segmentation model for video sequences. The project is an official implementation of the FCIS method and utilizes MXNet as the backend for deep learning.

> CONFERENCE
==========

The FCIS project was presented at the [CVPR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03114) conference and has been widely recognized in the computer vision community.

> DATASET
========

The FCIS project utilizes the [UrbanSound8k](https://www.emiliopedrona-lab.com/urbansound8k/) dataset, which contains a large collection of urban sound recordings.

> EVALMETRIC
===========

The FCIS project uses the following evaluation metrics to assess its performance:

* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* BLEU Score
