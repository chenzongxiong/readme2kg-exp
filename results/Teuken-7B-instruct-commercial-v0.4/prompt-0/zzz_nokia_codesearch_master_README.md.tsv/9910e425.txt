**Original Text:**
It implements retrieval systems for annotated code snippets: pairs of a code snippet and a short natural language description. The system uses a pre-trained transformer model for code snippet representation and matching. It is based on the CodeSnippets2Vec model, which learns a representation and matching for code snippets. The system is evaluated on the EMNLP 2023 code snippets dataset and achieves competitive results.
