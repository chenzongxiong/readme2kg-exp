The newly introduced graph classification datasets are available at [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/#disjointgraphs), [TUD Graph Kernel Datasets](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets), and [GraphLearning.io](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/).  --------------------------------------------------------------  **Citing**  If you find *Karate Club* and the new datasets useful in your research, please consider citing the following paper:  ```bibtex @inproceedings{karateclub,        title = {{Karate Club: An API Oriented Open-source Python Framework for Unsupervised Learning on Graphs}},        author = {Benedek Rozemberczki and Oliver Kiss and Rik Sarkar},        year = {2020},        pages = {3125â€“3132},        booktitle = {Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '20)},        organization = {ACM}, } ``` ----------------------------------------------------------------  **A simple example**  *Karate Club* makes the use of modern community detection techniques quite easy (see [here](https://karateclub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html) for the accompanying tutorial).
