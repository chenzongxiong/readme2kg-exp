**WORKSHOP:** IJCNN 2017 Workshop on Deep Learning and Cognitive Computing

The IJCNN 2017 Workshop on Deep Learning and Cognitive Computing was held in conjunction with the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in Stockholm, Sweden. This workshop aimed to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss and present the latest advances in deep learning and cognitive computing. One of the main focuses of the workshop was on the use of these techniques in the context of computer vision, natural language processing, and other related fields.

During the workshop, several papers were presented, including "Deep Learning for Scene Understanding: A Benchmark and Analysis of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" and "Learning Visual Representations for Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths with Knowledge Tracing." These papers presented novel approaches to improving the performance of deep learning models in various applications.

In addition to the oral presentations, the workshop also included a poster session where researchers could showcase their work in more detail. One of the posters presented was "A Novel Approach to Sequence Labeling with Knowledge Tracing." This poster provided a detailed overview of the methodology and results of the authors' research.

The workshop also featured a panel discussion on the future of deep learning and cognitive computing. This discussion brought together experts from various fields to discuss the latest trends and challenges in these areas, as well as the potential impact of these technologies on society.

The workshop was concluded with a poster session, where researchers could present their work in more detail. One of the posters presented was "Deep Learning for Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths: A Comparative Study of Different Approaches." This poster provided a detailed overview of the methodology and results of the authors' research.

In summary, the IJCNN 2017 Workshop on Deep Learning and Cognitive Computing was a valuable opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their latest advances in the field of deep learning and cognitive computing. The workshop provided a platform for researchers to present their work, engage in discussions, and exchange ideas with their peers. The workshop also served as a valuable resource for researchers in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the latest trends and challenges in these areas.
