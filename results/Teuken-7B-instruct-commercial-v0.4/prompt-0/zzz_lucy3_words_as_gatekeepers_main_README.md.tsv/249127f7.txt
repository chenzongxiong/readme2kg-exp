## Annotation Rules
- Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
- Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
- Annotate nested entities separately.
- Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
- Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).

Output Format:
```perl
# Use `wiktionary_eval.sh` to run wiktionary evaluation steps for clustering and assigning.
```
