The **abstract\_id**=4210199) is a research paper titled "***Bigot NDTs for knowledge distillation***". It was presented at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). The paper proposes the use of "Tree-Like Decision Distillation" as a method for knowledge distillation, where a trained teacher network is used to provide soft targets for training a fuzzy NDT. The authors, Jie Song *et al.*, use a layer-wise dissect approach to analyze the decision process of a DNN, and their findings can be found in their paper [[Paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Song_Tree-Like_Decision_Distillation_CVPR_2021_paper.html).

The **Tree-Like Branching Network for Multi-class Classification** paper, presented at the 2021 Latin American and Caribbean Neural Networks School (LNNS), proposes a novel network called the Tree-Like Branching Network for Multi-class Classification. This network is designed to mine the underlying category relationships from a trained teacher network and determines the appropriate layers on which specialized branches grow. The authors, Mengqi Xue, Jie Song, Li Sun, and Mingli Song, have published their work in their paper [[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93247-3_18).

In the paper **"Distilling a Neural Network Into a Soft Decision Tree"**, presented at the 2017 Artificial Intelligence (AI*)IA* conference, Nicholas Frosst and Geoffrey Hinton propose using a trained NN to provide soft targets for training a fuzzy NDT. The authors' code can be found on GitHub at <https://github.com/kimhc6028/soft-decision-tree>.

The paper **"TNT: An Interpretable Tree-Network-Tree Learning Framework using Knowledge Distillation"**, presented at the 2020 Entropy conference, proposes a framework called TNT for Tree-Network-Tree learning. The authors transfer knowledge between tree models and DNNs, and their findings are discussed in their paper [[Paper]](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/11/1203).

The paper **"KDExplainer: A Task-oriented Attention Model for Explaining Knowledge Distillation"**, presented at the 2021 arXiv conference, proposes a task-oriented attention model called KDExplainer for explaining the knowledge distillation process. The authors
