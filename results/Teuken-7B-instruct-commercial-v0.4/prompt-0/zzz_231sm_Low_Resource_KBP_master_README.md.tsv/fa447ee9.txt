Here's the annotated text with entities directly included in the original text using XML-style tags:
```perl
# Low_Resource_KBP knowledge graph population in low resource conditions   The file "*Few-Shot_ED.json.zip*" is the ***FewEvent*** dataset for the paper accepted by WSDM 2020 ***["Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11621)***   ## Source of Raw Data * We first scale up the number of event types in existing datasets, including the [ACE-2005 corpus](http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/), and [TAC-KBP-2017 Event Track Data](https://tac.nist.gov/2017/KBP/Event/index.html)
```
In this text, there are no entities that require specific classes. Therefore, the entities are annotated with the general class "ENTITY".
