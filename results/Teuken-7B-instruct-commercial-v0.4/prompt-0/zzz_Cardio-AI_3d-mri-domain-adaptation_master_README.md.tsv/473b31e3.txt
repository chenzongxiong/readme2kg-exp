Here's the annotated text:
```markdown
The Dataset is widely used for creating ontologies.
The Evaluate module is responsible for evaluating the model predictions.
The Predict module loads an experiment config and a pre-trained model, transforms AX CMR into the SAX domain, applies the task network, transforms the predicted mask back into the AX domain, undoes the generator steps, and saves the prediction to disk.
The Train module inspects the generators, defines an experiment config, loads and injects a task network, builds the graph, and trains a new AX2SAX model.
