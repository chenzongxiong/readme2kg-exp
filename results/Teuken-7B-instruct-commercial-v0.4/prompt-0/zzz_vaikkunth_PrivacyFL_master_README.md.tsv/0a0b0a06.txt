The <CONFERENCE>International Semantic Web Conference 2019</CONFERENCE>, held in Brisbane, Australia, was a remarkable event for researchers in the field of web and semantic technologies. <DATASET>Maules Creek</DATASET>, a dataset used for natural language processing tasks, was discussed in one of the sessions. Evaluation metrics such as <EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC>, <EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC>, <EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC>, and <EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC> were used to assess the performance of various models. <ONTOLOGY>Intelligence Task Ontology</ONTOLOGY> was referenced during the workshop on "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection". <LICENSE>cc-by-3</LICENSE> and <LICENSE>CC BY-NC 4.0</LICENSE> licenses were discussed in the context of using resources. <PROGLANG>Python</PROGLANG>, <PROGLANG>PHP</PROGLANG>, and <PROGLANG>C++</PROGLANG> were examples of programming languages mentioned in the context of a project. <PROJECT>Paper With Code</PROJECT>, a project hosted at <https://paperswithcode.com/>, was highlighted in a publication titled "No Length Left Behind: Enhancing Knowledge Tracing for Modeling Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths". <PUBLICATION>Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</PUBLICATION> was the source of the publication. <SOFTWARE>Protege ontology editor</SOFTWARE>, a software tool for creating ontologies, was used in the context of a workshop on "Thermal Image Super-Resolution".
