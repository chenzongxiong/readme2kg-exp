The second step in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) process is to generate pseudo labels. This involves refining model predictions with learned features to improve the accuracy of the final results. To do this, you can use techniques such as graph-based label propagation or clustering-based label assignment.

Here's an example of how to generate pseudo labels using graph-based label propagation:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx

# Load the model predictions
model_predictions = pd.read_csv("model_predictions.csv")

# Define the graph structure
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes for each entity
entities = set(["CONFERENCE", "DATASET", "EVALMETRIC", "LICENSE", "ONTOLOGY", "PROJECT", "PUBLICATION", "SOFTWARE", "WORKSHOP"])
for entity in entities:
    G.add_node(entity)

# Add edges between related entities
for _, row in model_predictions.iterrows():
    entity1 = row["entity1"]
    entity2 = row["entity2"]
    G.add_edge(entity1, entity2)

# Apply label propagation algorithm
labels = nx.label_propagation(G)
```
In this example, we first load the model predictions into a Pandas DataFrame. We then define the graph structure, which consists of nodes for each entity and edges between related entities. We apply the graph-based label propagation algorithm using the `nx.label_propagation` function, which assigns labels to each node based on the relationships between nodes.

The resulting labels can be used to refine the model predictions and improve the overall accuracy of the NER process.
