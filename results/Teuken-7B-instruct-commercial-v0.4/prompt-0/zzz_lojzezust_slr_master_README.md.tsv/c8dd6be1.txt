Prepare\_object\_masks
------------------------

The `Prepare_object_masks` function is responsible for converting weakly-annotated bounding boxes into masks that can be used for training. This process is essential for creating accurate object detection models.

This function is part of the larger framework that aims to improve the efficiency of training object detection models. By converting weak annotations into masks, the model can focus on learning the underlying patterns in the data instead of wasting time on irrelevant details.

The function takes in weakly-annotated bounding boxes and outputs corresponding object masks. This step is crucial for improving the accuracy and robustness of the object detection model.

This function is an essential part of the overall pipeline for training object detection models. By efficiently converting weak annotations into useful masks, the model can learn more effectively and achieve better performance on the task of object detection.

In summary, the `Prepare_object_masks` function is a key component of the larger framework that aims to improve the efficiency of training object detection models. By converting weak annotations into useful masks, the model can learn more effectively and achieve better performance on the task of object detection.
