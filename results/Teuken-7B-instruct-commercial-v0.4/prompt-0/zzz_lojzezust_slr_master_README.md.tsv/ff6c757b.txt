Link Datasets Directory and Create an Output Directory
=======================================================

The first step is to link the datasets directory and create an output directory to store the annotations. This can be done using the following steps:

1. Link the datasets directory:
```bash
ln -s datasets data
```
2. Create an output directory:
```bash
mkdir output
```
These steps will link the datasets directory to the data folder and create an output directory named "output" to store the annotations.
