## Annotation Rules
- Include the entire proper name but exclude standalone generic descriptors (e.g., exclude "Dataset" in "BookSum Dataset").
- Use a single-class annotation per entity, based on the context.
- Annotate nested entities separately.
- Include punctuation marks only if part of the entity (e.g., titles with ":" in "PAV-SOD: Panoramic Audiovisual Saliency Detection").
- Annotate entities within URLs (e.g., "llama" in `https://ai.meta.com/llama`).

- Output Format:
- Return the original content with entities directly annotated using XML-style tags for their respective classes. Example:
```
The <SOFTWARE>Protege Ontology Editor</SOFTWARE> is widely used for creating ontologies.
