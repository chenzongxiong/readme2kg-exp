# CONFERENCE: International Semantic Web Conference 2019
<CONFERENCE>Conference</CONFERENCE> held in <CONFERENCE>2019</CONFERENCE>, focused on <CONFERENCE>Semantic Web</CONFERENCE> and <CONFERENCE>Artificial Intelligence</CONFERENCE> technologies.

# DATASET: Malicious Software Detection
<DATASET>Dataset</DATASET> featuring <DATASET>Malicious</DATASET> and <DATASET>Benign</DATASET> samples, along with their associated features and labels.

# EVALMETRIC: Precision
<EVALMETRIC>Precision</EVALMETRIC> measures the accuracy of positive predictions, considering the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.
The precision of a model can be computed as (TP / TP + FP)

# EVALMETRIC: Recall
<EVALMETRIC>Recall</EVALMETRIC> measures the fraction of relevant entities that were retrieved by the model, considering the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives and false negatives.
The recall of a model can be computed as (TP / TP + FN)

# EVALMETRIC: F1-Score
<EVALMETRIC>F1-Score</EVALMETRIC> is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both metrics.
The F1-score can be computed as 2 \* (precision \* recall) / (precision + recall)

# EVALMETRIC: BLEU Score
<EVALMETRIC>BLEU Score</EVALMETRIC> evaluates the semantic similarity between the model's output and the reference translation.
The BLEU score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better semantic similarity.
