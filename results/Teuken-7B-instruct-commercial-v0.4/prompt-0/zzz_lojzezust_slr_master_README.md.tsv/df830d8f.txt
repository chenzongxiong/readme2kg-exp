```bash chmod +x tools/train_slr.sh tools/train_slr.sh ```

The script contains the following variables, that can be changed to achieve the desired results:
```makefile
MODEL_NAME=bert
EPOCHS=5
BATCH_SIZE=16
DATA_PATH=data/
SAVE_PATH=saved_models/
TOKENIZER_NAME=bert-base-uncased
MAX_LEN=512
LEARNING_RATE=1e-5
```
To use the script, you can simply run the following command:
```bash python
python tools/train_slr.py --config_name=<your_config_name>
```
Replace `<your_config_name>` with the desired configuration name, such as `small-bert-base-uncased` or `large-bert-large-uncased`.
